        <p>Name: Lewis</p>
        <p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/lu1a">github.com/lu1a</a></p>
        <p>Trying to master: zig && python</p>
        <p>Currently working on: <a href="https://github.com/lu1a/zython">zython</a> (who could've guessed...)</p>
        <p>Recruiter-friendly page: <a href="https://lu1.sh/boring">lu1.sh/boring</a></p>

        <p>I use python to mock things up and do corporate programming. Beyond that, I am in the camp that software isn't worth
        being written at all if it's not worth writing in a compiled non-GC language.</p>

        <p>If you want to hire me or work on something together, <a href="tg://resolve?domain=lewistorrington">get in touch on Telegram.</a></p>
